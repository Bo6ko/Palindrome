You can see the script in palindrome.js file. For Additional and to be more easy I create index.html file where you can enter words or sentences in input field. After that when you click to the button - you go to the function isPalindrome, which return true if your entered words is palindrome and false if it is not palindrome. My logic is simple. In this function isPalindrome() I just loop every character of the word or the sentences, which you entered in input field. After loop I get the revert word or sentences and I save it in another variable. Finally I just check if the entered word and reverse word are equal - and that return true or false.
